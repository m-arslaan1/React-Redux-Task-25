I recently started learning about Redux Toolkit and applied it to implement a simple online shopping cart system. Initially, I used the Context API for the same purpose. While it was challenging at first, I sought assistance from various online resources, but much of the development was done independently. As a result, I have successfully created a fully functional webpage.
